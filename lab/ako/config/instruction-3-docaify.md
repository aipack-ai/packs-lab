With all of this content, create a very concise, dry, but complete single documentation file that contains all of the necessary information for an LLM or Agent to be able to use the APIs.

Guidelines for the single:
- Create very concise, dry, but complete API documentation
- For scripting languages, like JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python, use TypeScript type definitions to express types and function signatures
- For typed languages, use the language typing system
- Remove redundant explanations, verbosity, and unnecessary descriptions
- If the type, signature, or arguments speak for themselves, be dry, you do not need to add anything
- Only add additional information if nuance or something could be ambiguous or not clear from the type or function signature 
- Focus on API signatures, parameters, return types, and essential usage notes
- Organize content logically by module or feature
- Preserve all essential information needed to use the APIs
- Remove navigation elements, duplicate content, and filler text
